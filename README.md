# unemployment-analysis
This project aims to visualize and analyze unemployment trends across counties and states in the United States using historical data. By leveraging Python data science libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the project uncovers patterns influenced by economic recessions and regional disparities.
# ðŸ“Š Visualising and Analyzing the Unemployment Rate Dataset

This project explores and visualizes the **US Unemployment Rate** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It uses Google Colab as the environment and draws insights into historical trends and economic events such as recessions.
